# Price: 20â‚¬

This is a small project improving(by making it cheaper) my previous solution to an API monitor in our Kitchen

### Materials:
ESP32
4x27 I2C Display
4 Jumper Cables
### Tools:
Hot Glue :D
3d printer
### 3d Files:
3d Files are on my thingiverse: [thingverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7018258)
not sure if im allowed to publish my educational license Inventor files but if you ask nicely i can change them for you
### Setup:
in the first few lines of main.cpp change **ssid** to your wlans ssid, **pwd** to your password, **stop** to your StopNumber which can be found by using test.py and changing the req for a route that passes by your stop
### Assembling:
should be straight forward
1. connect as following: [randomnerdtutorials](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-esp8266-i2c-lcd-arduino-ide/)
2. fold the connected pins of the ESP to the Side(if you are using jumpers)
3. maybe put a bit of hot glue on it to fixate it
4. print the case
5. set in the ESP s.t. the MicroUSB goes through the hole
6. set the display in the top part, such that it fits, there are dents for the cables to pass through
7. move the cabels around
8. if you want a wall install then now is the time to use the 3 holes to fixate it on the wall as it is not that easyly opeanable 
9. carefully but forcefully press the case together watch that no cables get loose or clamped
### Opening:
carfully wedge something on one side
